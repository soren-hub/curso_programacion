An Analysis of Yukon Delta Salmon ManagementRita Asgeirsson, Western Washington UniversityThe broad range of Pacific Alaskan salmon has resulted in the creation of a complex and multi-organizational system of management that includes the state of Alaska, various federal departments, a Congressionally-mandated fishery council, and a number of commercial and non-governmental fish organizations.  In the Bering Sea salmon are caught by the commercial groundfish fleet as by-catch.  On the Yukon River salmon are commercially and traditionally 
harvested for both economic and cultural sustenance by the Yupâ€™ik residents of the Yukon Delta.  Declining salmon populations has driven scientific research which considers the effects of Bering Sea salmon by-catch.
