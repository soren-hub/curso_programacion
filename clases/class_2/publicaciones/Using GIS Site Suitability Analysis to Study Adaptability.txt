Using GIS Site Suitability Analysis to Study Adaptability and Evolution of Life: Locating Springs in Mantle Units of OphiolitesAlexandrea Bowman, University of Rhode IslandGIS is a powerful tool that can be used to locate springs sourced in ophiolites. The unique features associated with these springs include a reducing subsurface environment reacting at low temperatures producing high pH, Ca-rich formation fluids with high dissolved hydrogen and methane. Because of their unique chemical characteristics, these areas are often associated with microbes and are thought to be similar to the features that enabled life to evolve on Earth. Locating and sampling these springs could offer a deeper look into Earth's deep biosphere and the history of life on Earth. Springs have tradiitionally been located using expensive and time consuming field techniques. Field work can be dangerous.
